QxAdmin v1.12a


------------------------------
Description
------------------------------

Using QxAdmin you can remotely controls QuakeWorld, Quake 2,
Quake 3: Arena servers from a Win32 machine. It can be used, also,
as a simple server public status program.

The server can be on any kind of machine. At the time of this writing,
servers exist for these platforms: Linux, Win32, MacOS, OS X.

This program includes all the functions of qwadmin(the original, 
not DrDrain's one) and q2admin, I also wrote those.

Source code is included, see the "Source code" section below.

*** New this version: see bottom of "Usage" section.

Please submit bugs reports, suggestions, flames(not too much) to:

Thanks to Barbat for his suggestions and web site design.
Thanks to Gag for his suggestions and for the strange bugs reports.

Installation
------------------------------

Just Unzip the files in a directory of your choice.
You better know how to do that.

If QxAdmin failed to start and a message box saying something like
"The QXADMIN.EXE file is linked to missing export MFC42.DLL:6778", 
go to the link below and download the appropriate update:
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/contents/common/mfc.htm

You can also download only MFC42.dll here: "http://www.planetquake.com/qxadmin/MFC42.zip"
and extract it in your QxAdmin directory, but do this at your own risk.

------------------------------
Usage
------------------------------

1- set the server address in the "Server address" box

2- set the server port in the "Port" box. If you didn't change it
   on your server you can leave this box empty: choosing the type
   (see below) will set the default port. Default port for
   QuakeWorld: 27500, Quake 2: 27910, Quake 3:Arena: 27960.

3- set the server type with radio buttons beside "Server type"
   If you don't know what kind of server it is you can check
   "Auto-detect" but that's very unlikely :)

4- Test if you can ping the server with the "Get public status"
   button. If the server does not respond check the previous
   three settings.
   
5- set the rcon password in the "rcon password" box. You should
   have set it in the server beforehand. In Quakeworld do something
   like this(in the server console): rcon_password "qxadminrules!".
   In Quake 2: set rcon_password "qxadminrules!"
   In Q3:Arena: set rconpassword "qxadminrules!"

6- Test if you have entered the right rcon password by using the
   "rcon status" button. If that worked(there's a normal "status"
   output in the remote console box), you are all set. If not, verify
   both rcon passwords on the server and in QxAdmin.

+ If the server port box is empty and you click one of the QuakeWorld,
  Quake 2, Quake 3 type buttons the default port is put in the port box.

+ You can edit console variables by double-clicking or right-clicking
  on their names.

+ You can send any normal commands, set variables, etc., in the
  bottom remote console entry box as you would do in a normal
  server console. You can press ENTER after you have entered the
  command to send it.
  
+ There's a 10 servers history and a 20 commands history. This
  history is saved in the "qxadmin.ini" file. No registry crap!

- New in version 1.0:
---------------------

+ You can kick players by right clicking on one then selecting "Kick!"
  Is this is easy or what?

+ If "Always console vars" is selected the server infos box always displays
  console variables in place of the public server infos. You need to set the
  rcon password first to use that. [Someone suggested this feature but I can't
  remember his name. E-mail me back!]

+ If "Always default port on type select" is selected, the default port
  for is set in the port box when selecting the server type.

+ The Quake 3:Arena colored names are displayed as regular characters.

+ Server port spin control(up-down arrows)

+ Server infos scrollbar memory

- New in version 1.01:
---------------------

+ Auto update: At specified interval QxAdmin do a "Get Public Stats"

+ Fixed a little bug in libqxadm.dll (timeout set too long)

- New in version 1.02:
---------------------
+ Disabled some buttons in QW mode and squased a bug with the auto-update spin
  control(thanks to Barbat for pointing this out.)

- New in version 1.03:
---------------------
+ Fixed bug with the right-click menu kick command

- New in version 1.1:
---------------------

+ console variables refresh should be faster

+ 'rlogview': allow the viewing of console logs in real time, requires 'rlogviewd'
  (included in this archive) to run on the server computer.
  
+ 'rlogviewd': must run on the server to use rlogview. If your server run on win32
  uses the included .exe(and download cygwin1.zip from the website and unzip it in
  the same directory as rlogviewd.exe).
  If not, you will have to compile 'rlogviewd.c' on it.
  A simple 'gcc -O2 rlogviewd.c -o rlogview' should do.

- New in version 1.12:
---------------------
+ A couple of things and some others(I lost the changes in a HD 'crash')

- New in version 1.12a:
----------------------
+ Enlarged the port edit box to display correctly 5 digits


=== Using rlogview/rlogviewd ===

o Setting-up the server(rlogviewd):
  
  I assume you have the rlogviewd executable (see above).

  Open 'rlogviewd.cfg'(included in this archive). There's 5 options:
  'password': password required to log in rlogviewd
  'port': TCP/IP port that rlogviewd listen to
  'quiet': if "1": reduced somewhat screen output
  'logfile': the actual file that rlogviewd will monitor for update
  'key': encoding key used to 'encrypt' data sent to clients (and to decode data
         coming from clients). See setting-up the client below.

o Setting-up the client(QxAdmin/rlogview)
  
  Start QxAdmin.exe. Click on the 'Show rlogview' button.
  Then click the 'Generate' button. Select the hash key and copy it to the clipboard.
  Paste it(or type it) in the rlogviewd.cfg on the server side.
  For example: If in the hash key edit box there is: "3F87A6B9", you must have a line
  in rlogviewd.cfg like this: key = "3F87A6B9"

  Setup the port, password edit-boxes with the same values as the ones in the
  rlogviewd.cfg file.

* After setting-up both the client and the server, start the server and if
  there's no error you can click the 'Connect' button on the client. You should
  see a message box saying that everything is allright.


* NOTES REGARDING LOG FILES *

You can use the rcon command 'logfile' to generate logfiles.
In Q2 I recommend using 'logfile 3', in Q3: 'logfile 2'(3 doesn't work).
In Quakeworld: the logfile seems to be written only when the server quits(or every
many minutes), so that render rlogview pretty useless... But:
You can also redirect the output like this: "quake2.exe > baseq2\qconsole.log"

------------------------------
Source code
------------------------------

Included in this archive is the source code used to build QxAdmin,
both for the main .exe(QxAdmin) and the server querying .dll(libqxadm).

You can easily write a program using only the .dll and do whatever you
want with the server reply. For example, it could be used to create
a server pinger tool. Use your imagination!

The source is in C++. The .dll is plain C++. The main .exe uses MFC.
The projects files for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 are also included.

You can look at "test.cpp" in the libqxadm directory for a mini example
of what libqxadm can do.

libqxadm can be compiled on unix systems(tested in Linux).
